<b>Help File:</b> Site Promotions
<br><br>
Site Promotions are very powerful methods of increasing your orders and order sizes.  There are three basic site promotions avilable with your system. Each promotion is based on dates for its "Live" period.  
<br><br>
You can have all the promotions turning live at the same time, but only one will actually be used.  It is recommended that you do NOT have more than one live at a time.  
<br><br>
If you wish to have all promotions turned OFF, set each date into the past (ie before today).  This will insure that the promotions will not be displayed.
