The product importer imports product information into Tradingeye.  It uses a flat file database (.csv) with various delimiter options.
</p>
 <p>
A flat file is usually setup with one row of data equaling one record and each item in that row is seperated by a delimiter character, Pipe (|), Semi Colon (;), Comma (,).
</p>
<p>
To use the Tradingeye product importer, you must tell it how your flat file database is setup.  There is a series of select lists that are all the same, labeled 1-33, one for each field availble in the database.
</p>
<p>
The first "column" in your flat file database would corrolate to the first select list, if it is a Product title in your flat file, then select title in the first select list, if description is the second "column" in your flat file, choose description on the number 2 select list and so on.
