		<p>The Gift Certificate builder gives you the ability to create a gift certificate and provide a code to your customers that they can use online for their purchases.</p>
		<p>Gift Certificates are like cash, if you have a £25.00 gift certificate, and the order is £35.00 (total), then the customer only has to pay £10.00 out of their own pocket.  As well if the order is £10.00 (total) then the customer still has £15.00 available.</p>
		<p>It is recommended that you do not delete any gift certificates after they have been used, this will benefit for customer lookups and reporting.</p>
