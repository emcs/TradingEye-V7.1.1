Text areas are different areas throughout your Tradingeye Shop website that allow you to customise the information contained in those areas.
<br><br>
Most of the text areas depend on the default system, if you make changes or customise the templates or application, the text areas may no longer work.
<br><br>
HTML code is valid inside of text areas as well as PHP code too!
