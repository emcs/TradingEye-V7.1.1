		<p>The "Lead List" is a very powerful marketing tool. It gives you the ability to select various product(s) and create a list of email names who have previously purchased these product(s) within a specified timeframe.</p>
		
		<p>Example: If you would like to send an email to all the customers who purchased Men's Blue Shirts, you would use the Lead List to select all your Men's Blue Shirts, it will go through your past orders and find all the customers associated with those products.</p>
		
		<p>You can then use the Lead List editor to send a special email to those people telling them whatever you wish, maybe tell them that the shirts are on sale or you are offering a promotion or even remind them that it may be time to purchase again or more!</p>
		
		<p>To use the Lead List editor, select departments, choose product(s) and add them to your lead list.  Once you have all of your products selected, you will need to go to Step 2.</p>
		
		<p>Step two lets you specify the date range in which to look up orders, and also allows you to create a unique name for this list.</p>
		
		<p>Once saved, you can use the Email Campaign Editor to select your lead list and send a message to all those customers who have opted in to your mail list.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> The number of emails gathered while building the lead list will vary from the actual number of emails being sent. Since customers change their minds on recieving email and may choose to update their preferences accordingly, all customers who match your criteria to the list will be added before Tradingeye then picks out the ones who do not wish to recieve emails. The campaign is then sent to the addresses left on the list.</p>
