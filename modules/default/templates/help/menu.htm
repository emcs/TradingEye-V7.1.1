The menu builder can build additional menus on your site. (This is not be confused with your departments).  The menu builder is great for building items such as links to external pages or building a new department list. <br>
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Menu Headers</strong> - Descriptive headers such as "Information", "Special Features", "Resources" ect..</li>
	<li><strong>Menu Items</strong> - The actual links and information below the headers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You create the menu header, and then click on the View Sub Items link related to that particular menu header to add/edit individual menu items.
</p>
<p>
If you wish to add links to departments, content or products in your menu items, you will just need to copy and paste the URL from the site into your url form field in the menu item editor.
