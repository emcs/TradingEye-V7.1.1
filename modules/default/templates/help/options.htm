		Each option item can be tracked with stock control, but if you do use stock, you can only have one option per page.  If stock is turned on in your Tradingeye admin, the option levels will be adjusted with each order.  Once the option item reaches 0, it will be turned off and not available.  If you select "Allow Backordering", then the item will NOT be turned off and avaialble for order but with a backorder status.
