		<p>The Associate Items feature is a very powerful tool that helps you rapidly populate your site and cross promote your products.</p>
		<p>This tool gives you the ability to "grab" objects from one department and duplicate them into another.</p>
		
		<p>When an object is grabbed, a second copy of the object isn't created. instead, Tradingeye remembers that this object can be found in the current location, as well as the location it was originally imported from.</p>
		
		<p>Placing objects in multiple areas is unlimited. An example would be a T-shirt that you currently have listed in Men's Clothing.  First, drill into another department such as Women's clothing, click the Find (department,content,product) link and choose the Men's Clothing. View these items and select the desired t-shirt, then click "Associate Item(s)".  This will take the t-shirt record id and associate it with in Women's clothing. You now have the same t-shirt in both Men's and Women's clothing departments.</p>
		
		<p>You can also place this t-shirt in various other departments, content pages and other product pages.</p>
		
		<p>Again, it does not duplicate the product, content or department record, it just uses a stub record to associate itself with another object. If you make a change to that t-shirt, it changes thoughout the site.</p>
