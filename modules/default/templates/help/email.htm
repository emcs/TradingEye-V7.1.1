		<p>The Email Campaign feature lets you send bulk emails to your customer base.</p>
		
		<p>There are two types of email you can send, HTML and text.  HTML provides for HTML code inside the email.  Text is just that - a plain, unformatted text email.</p>
		
		<p>When a customer sign's up, they are given a choice of HTML or Text emails (or "Not Sure", which sets them to plain text).</p>
		
		<p>After you have completed your email, Tradingeye will send the email to the appropriate customers.</p>
		
		<p>Source ID (SID) is an identifier that allows you to track your email campaigns. If you put a link inside of your email message, follow it with an SID value. Tradingeye will pass that value throughout the site and into the order if the customer orders. This way you can track the effectiveness of your email campaigns.</p>
		
		<p>Example: /sid/sid1234 where "1234" is your SID value (this number should be unique for simple tracking).</p>
		
		<p>/sid/sid1234 is a query string called name value pairs, the first part (before the /) is the name, and the second part (after the /sid) is the value.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
		
		<p>http://www.domain.com/index.php/sid/sid1234</p>
